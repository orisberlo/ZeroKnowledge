\section*{Dimension Of Linear Spaces}
Given vectors $\set{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k}$ we can ask two questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Does the vectors $\set{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k}$ spans $V$.

\item
Are these vectors linearly independent.
\end{enumerate}

We saw that the answer for this questions is independent. It is possible that this set spans $V$ yet linear dependent or vise-versa. It could that the answer for both question is negative or positive.

\begin{defn}
Vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ that are linearly independent and span $V$ are called a basis for $V$.
\end{defn}

\paragraph{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
The vectors $\set{(1,0,0) , (0,1,0) , (0,0,1)}$ are linearly independent and span $\R^3$ hence basis for $\R^3$.  These basis is often called the standard basis for $\R^3$.

\item
The vectors $\set{(1,1,1) , (1,1,0)}$ are linearly independent but does not span $\R^3$ (hence not a basis). For example, the vector $(0,0,1)$ is not a linear combination of these vectors.

\item
The vectors $\set{(1,1,1) , (1,0,1) , (0,1,0)}$ are linearly dependent and does not span $\R^3$. 

\item 
The vectors $\set{(1,0,0) , (1,1,0) , (1,1,1) , (0,1,0)}$ are linearly dependent and span $\R^3$. 
\end{enumerate}

Does every vector space have a basis? This is a legitimate question and the answer is affirmative. A constructive constructive approach to find a basis is to start with vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_m$ that span $V$ and then throw out some of them until we get an independent set. If $v_1,\ldots,v_m$ are linearly dependent then there exists a vector which is a linear combination of the rest and thus if we lose this vector we still span $V$. Eventually, we would be left with an independent set which spans $V$. Seemingly, we prove that every linear space has a finite basis which is not true. The problem is that we cannot assume that there exists a finite set of vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_m$ that spans $V$. If this set is not finite then this argument simply does not work. This argument is completely valid if $V$ has a finite spanning set. Such spaces are called "Finite Dimensional Linear Spaces" and we will restrict ourselves only to these spaces. 

Are there different basis for the same vector space? Evidently yes as the above examples show but what about different cardinality? Is there a basis for $\R^3$ with two vectors? What about four vectors? The answer for this question is negative as the next theorem asserts.

\begin{thm}
Every basis for $V$ has the same cardinality.
\end{thm}

This astonishing result means that every vector space comes along with a parameter which is the cardinality of its basis. We shall refer to this parameter as the dimension of the vector space and denote it $\dim V$. 

The constructive approach to find basis presented above can be extended in the following manner. Suppose $\set{u_1,\ldots,u_m}$ are linearly independent and $\set{w_1,\ldots,w_n}$ span $V$ then we can add $u_1$ to the $w$'s obtaining,
$$\set{u_1, w_1,\ldots,w_n}$$
which is clearly linearly dependent thus we can remove one the $w$'s and still span $V$. Continuing this process we get that $m \leq n$. Notice that we can always avoid removing $u_i$'s since these vectors are linearly independent. This tells us that the size of a linearly independent set is always less or equal the size of a spanning set. Using this argument any two basis for $V$ must have the same size.

\section*{Linear Dependency}
Let us return to the problem of solving a homogeneous system of linear equations. Consider the two equations system,
$$
\begin{cases}
2x - y &= 0\\
6x - 3y &= 0\\
\end{cases}
$$
As previously remarked, the second equation is a the first equation multiplied by 3. In this case the solutions are described by the equation $y=2x$ and there are infinitely many solutions. Now take a look at the following two equations system, 
$$
\begin{cases}
2x - y &= 0\\
x + y &= 0\\
\end{cases}
$$
This time, the system has a unique solution which is the trivial solution $x=0$,$y=0$. Evidently, if we take the second equation to be the first equation multiplied by some constant then we get infinitely many solutions which form a linear line otherwise we would get only the trivial solution $x=0$,$y=0$. Lets take a thirds system,  
$$
\begin{cases}
2x - 2y + 2z &= 0\\
4x - 4y + 4z&= 0\\
8x - 8y + 8z&= 0\\
\end{cases}
$$

This is just as the first example yet the solutions obey to the three variables equation $2x-2y+2z=0$. This time the solution is not a line but a plane in $\R^3$. The fourth and last example is the following three variables homogeneous system with three equations,
$$
\begin{cases}
5x - 2y + 6z &= 0\\
2x + 2y + 2z&= 0\\
3x - 4y + 4z&= 0\\
\end{cases}
$$
Non of the equations is a multiplication of the other yet the third equation is the sum of the first two equations there is redundant. Indeed, the solution for this system will have one degree of freedom. These examples conveys the message that the degrees of freedom in a linear system of equations is related to the dependency within the equations. 

\paragraph{Linear Combination}
A linear combination is an expression of the form,
$$\alpha_1 v_1 + \alpha_2 v_2 +\ldots + \alpha_n v_n$$
where $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ are vectors and the $\alpha_n$ are scalars. 


\begin{defn}
\emph{(Linear Dependence)}
\label{(Linear Dependence)}
Set of vectors $\set{v_1,\ldots,v_k}$ are said to be linear dependent if,
$$\sum_{i=1}^{k} \alpha_i v_i = 0$$
for some scalars $\alpha_i$ not all zero. The set $\set{v_1,\ldots,v_k}$ is said to be linearly independent if it is not linearly dependent, that is $\sum_{i=1}^{k} \alpha_i v_i = 0$ if only if $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k$ are all zero.
\end{defn}


















Going back to the Euclidean space, we denote $e_1$,$e_2$,$e_3$ the unit vectors pointing in the $x$,$y$ and $z$ direction, namely $(1,0,0)$,$(0,1,0)$, $(0,0,1)$. A linear combination of these vectors might be,
\begin{align*}
3e_1 + 2e_2 - 5e_3 &= (3,2,-5)\\
2e_1 + 8e_2 - 2e_3 &= (2,8,-2)\\
5e_1 - 7e_2 + 5e_3 &= (5,-7,5)\\
\end{align*}
The first observation is that the resulted vectors are different. Does every different linear combination of $e_1$,$e_2$,$e_3$ results in a different vector? It is not hard to see that the answer for this question is affirmative. Another natural question, does any vector in $\R^3$ can be obtained via a linear combination of $e_1$,$e_2$,$e_3$?

Let us take another example. Consider the vectors $v_1=(1,0,0)$,$v_2=(0,1,0)$ and $v_3=(1,1,0)$ and some linear combinations of these vectors,
\begin{align*}
v_1 - v_2 + v_3 &= (2,0,0)\\
v_1 + v_2  -v_3 &= (0,0,0)\\
2v_1 = 2v_1 + 0\cdot v_2  + 0\cdot v_3 &= (2,0,0)\\
\end{align*}

Same questions. Does any vector in $\R^3$ can be obtained via a linear combination of $e_1$,$e_2$,$e_3$? No. Any linear combination of $v_1$,$v_2$,$v_3$ does not change the $z$ coordinate. Does every different linear combination of $v_1$,$v_2$,$v_3$ results in a different vector? Evidently no as the first and third combinations are different yet result in the same vector. Notice that the second combination gives an insight to the reason that it is impossible to require uniqueness. This is because it is a not trivial linear combination of the zero vector $(0,0,0)$ and thus we can add it to any linear combination and get another combination without changing the resulted vector.

We took several vectors $v_1, v_2 , \ldots , v_k$ and asked two questions. Can a vector $v$ be represented as a linear combinations of these vector and if so, does this representation is unique. 




\begin{defn}
Set of vectors $\set{v_1,\ldots,v_k}$ is said to span vector space $W$ if for every $w\in W$ there exists a linear combination of $\set{v_1,\ldots,v_k}$ that equals $w$
$$\sum_{i=1}^{k} \alpha_i v_i = w$$
\end{defn}

\paragraph{Examples}

\paragraph{Spans}
The span of a set of vectors $\set{v_1,\ldots,v_n}$ is the set of all linear combinations $\spann{v_1,\ldots,v_n}=\set{\sum \alpha_i v_i}$. It can be easily verified that $\spann{v_1,\ldots,v_n}$ is a vector space.
